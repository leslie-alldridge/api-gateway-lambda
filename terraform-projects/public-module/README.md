# Create my first public Terraform module

I would like to learn more about publishing shared modules in Terraform.

Publishing public modules is the same workflow for publishing private modules.

The code has to be stored in its own repository and meet certain criteria.

Requirements page: [terraform docs](https://www.terraform.io/docs/registry/modules/publish.html)

Please see my [public module repo](https://github.com/leslie-alldridge/terraform-aws-multiple-lambda-deployment)
