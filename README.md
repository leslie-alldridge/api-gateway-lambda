# Learn by doing

Purpose:

At the time of writing I have 283 repositories (lots of learning!).
I hope this new collection will help keep the number of repositories I have under
control.

Contents:

Snippets from Stackoverflow answers I've shared or minimal reproducible examples.
Will add more over time.
