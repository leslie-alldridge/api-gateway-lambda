# Learn by doing (November 2021 onward)

Purpose:

I have created this repository as a collection of things I have learned.

At the time of writing I have 283 repositories (lots of learning!).
I hope this new collection will help keep the number of repositories I have under
control.

Whilst not all of my learning in captured in GitHub, I will aim to track
boilerplates or small sample projects I have created, by myself or by following
a guide. Code here (even if following a guide) won't be copy pasted but instead
my own interpretation and modified code.

I have attempted to break projects down into logical units so if I forget how to
create a .zip archive in terraform, there will hopefully be an example in the
`terraform-projects` directory.

It's also fun to track my progress, looking back at old projects from 2018
reminds me how much work is involved in attaining (and maintaining) relevant
Engineering skills.
